## Run api locally

The api is using Node.js v16.

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/BTchorzewski/pantry-back.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd pantry-back
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
  
  or 
  
  npm install --force
 ```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start:dev
```

### SMTP server for the user registration feature.
Start a SMTP server only if you want to test user registration feature.
You can use the docker image that is indicated below or your own local smtp server for development.

If you want to use the smtp server, don't change an email configuration in a config file.
A client side for the rnwood/smtp4dev is available at http://localhost:3003/

```
docker run --rm -it -p 3003:80 -p 2525:25 rnwood/smtp4dev
```
you might have to 'sudo' before docker commend if you are using linux.

### Authentication and Authorization
JSON web token authentication and authorization are implemented however for developing purpose authorization feature can be disabled by uncomment and comment specific decorators.
The application uses access tokens as `bearer` value in a header and refresh tokens as a cookie. 
Important! Import a user table from the requirements' folder is compulsory because the application is mocking authorization.

Feel free to disabled authorization by commenting pointed decorators: `@UseGuards(AccessJwtGuard)` and `@UserId() userId,` and uncommenting `@MockedUserId() userId,` in the pantry controller.
